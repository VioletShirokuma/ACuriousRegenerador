<h2>Description:</h2>

This Password Generator application was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript that used functions to generate a password based on criteria you select from dialogue boxes you select from. This password app uses Javascript to run the randomizer function in order to create a password for you and your online security.



<h2>Learning Process: </h2>

What I learned to implement was how the Javascript intersects with the HTML, to create functions combined with prompts and confirm dialogue to enable the user to be able to generate a new password. Also learning how to properly structure the Javascript and make sense of the syntax in order for it to work, as well as researching certain functions (e.g. Copy/Paste function). I utilized  a lot of what was taught in class in bits and pieces to try to understand the bigger picture.

<h2>Difficulties/Challenges:</h2>

* Understanding the correlation between CSS and Javascript pages

* Ensuring the Javascript worked and what I was learning to build the Javascript was going to function

* Not getting lost and overwhelmed in the overall syntax
